. Find the Repository URL
You need the URL of the repository you want to clone. This can be found on the repository page
on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or other Git hosting services.
 For GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to clone.
 Click the green "Code" button on the repository page.
 You’ll see options for HTTPS and SSH. Choose the one that works for you:
o HTTPS (if you're unsure about SSH keys):
https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
o SSH (if you've set up SSH keys with GitHub):
git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
2. Clone the Repository
Once you have the repository URL, follow these steps:
Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, or terminal in your IDE):
1. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:
2. cd path/to/your/directory
3. Run the clone command with the URL of the repository:
4. git clone <repository_url>
Example for HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Example for SSH:
git clone git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
3. Navigate into the Cloned Repository
After cloning, Git creates a new folder with the same name as the repository (unless you specify
a different name).
Change to that directory:
cd repository-name
4. Verify the Clone
To check if the repository has been successfully cloned, you can list the files:
ls
You should see all the files and directories from the remote repository.
Also, check the remote URL using:
git remote -v
This should show the URL of the remote repository (e.g., origin
https://github.com/username/repository-name.git).
5. Pull Latest Changes (if needed)
If you’ve already cloned the repository earlier, but want to get the latest changes, you can always
pull the latest updates from the remote:
git pull origin main
or if it's using master as the default branch:
git pull origin master
